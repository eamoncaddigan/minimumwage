Looking at minimum wage data

###studentLoans.R

For each state, this maps the number of hours I'd need to work in a week at that state's minimum wage to keep up with my personal student loan repayments.

(It's broken right now because I updated minimum_wage.csv)

###scrapeLivingWage.R

This script scrapes the data from the [Living Wage Calculator](http://livingwage.mit.edu/). 

Eventually I'll map the number of hours necessary to work at a minimum wage to live in each state (I expect it's going to be > 40). :(
